**1. Introduction to Dynamic Binding**

The video explains the concept of dynamic binding in C++, which arises in the context of inheritance and polymorphism. The instructor sets the stage by describing a scenario where a base class pointer might point to an object of a derived class. Without dynamic binding, the base class version of a method would always be called, even if the derived class has an overridden version. Dynamic binding provides a mechanism to resolve the method call at runtime, ensuring the correct (derived class) version is executed.

**2. Class Hierarchy Example**

The instructor presents a simple class hierarchy:

- **Base:** The base class with two methods, `m1()` and `m2()`. `m1()` is declared as `virtual`.
- **Derived:** A class derived from `Base`, overriding both `m1()` and `m2()`. `m1()` is declared as `virtual` in Derived Class too.
- **Second:** A class derived from `Derived`, overriding both `m1()` and `m2()`.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void m1();
    void m2();
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    virtual void m1(); // Override
    void m2();       // Override
};

class Second : public Derived {
public:
    void m1();       // Override
    void m2();       // Override
};
```

**3. Static vs. Dynamic Binding**

- **Static Binding (Compile-Time Binding):** The compiler determines which function to call based on the _pointer's type_. This happens when the method is _not_ declared `virtual` in the base class. The decision is made at compile time.

- **Dynamic Binding (Runtime Binding / Late Binding):** The decision of which function to call is _delayed until runtime_. This is achieved by using the `virtual` keyword in the base class. The actual object's type (not the pointer's type) determines which version of the function is called.

**4. Cases/Examples**

The instructor walks through four cases to illustrate how dynamic binding works. These are crucial for understanding the core concept. In each case, these objects and pointers are used:

```cpp
Base *ptr;  // Pointer to Base
Base o1;    // Object of Base
Derived o2; // Object of Derived
Second o3;  // Object of Second
```

- **Case 1: Base Pointer, Base Object**

  ```cpp
  ptr = &o1;  // ptr points to a Base object
  ptr->m1(); // Calls Base::m1() -- Static Binding
  ptr->m2(); // Calls Base::m2() -- Static Binding
  ```

  Here, both `ptr->m1()` and `ptr->m2()` call the `Base` class versions. Since `ptr` is a `Base*`, the compiler checks for the methods in `Base`. Because both the pointer and the object are of type `Base`, this is straightforward static binding.

- **Case 2: Base Pointer, Derived Object**

  ```cpp
  ptr = &o2;  // ptr points to a Derived object
  ptr->m1(); // Calls Derived::m1() -- Late Binding (Dynamic Binding)
  ptr->m2(); // Calls Base::m2()   -- Static Binding
  ```

  This is where dynamic binding comes into play.

  - `ptr->m1()`: Even though `ptr` is a `Base*`, the _object_ it points to is a `Derived`. Because `m1()` is `virtual` in `Base`, the runtime system looks at the actual object type (`Derived`) and calls `Derived::m1()`.
  - `ptr->m2()`: Since `m2()` is _not_ `virtual` in `Base`, static binding applies. The compiler sees `ptr` as a `Base*` and calls `Base::m2()`.

- **Case 3: Base Pointer, Second Object (Grandchild)**

  ```cpp
  ptr = &o3; // ptr (Base*) points to a Second object
  ptr->m1();  // Calls Second::m1()  -- Late Binding (Dynamic Binding)
  ptr->m2(); // Calls Base::m2()    -- Static Binding
  ```

  This extends the previous case.

  - `ptr->m1()`: `m1()` is virtual in `Base`. The runtime system checks the object type (`Second`), finds `Second::m1()`, and calls it. The `virtual` keyword's effect "propagates" down the inheritance hierarchy.
  - `ptr->m2()`: Static binding; `Base::m2()` is called.

  The instructor asks a key question: What if `Second` _didn't_ override `m1()`? The answer is that `Derived::m1()` would be called. The runtime system looks for the _closest_ overridden version in the hierarchy.

- **Case 4: Derived Pointer, Second Object**

  ```cpp
  Derived *ptr;   // Change: ptr is now a Derived*
  ptr = &o3; // ptr points to a Second object
  ptr->m1(); // Calls Second::m1() -- Late Binding (Dynamic Binding)
  ptr->m2(); // Calls Derived::m2() --Static Binding
  ```

  Here, they changed the pointer type.

  - `ptr->m1();`: Although pointer type is `Derived*`, however, it calls `Second::m1();` at run time, because `m1()` has `virtual` keyword in `Base` and `Derived` classes.
  - `ptr->m2();`: Although the object type `second`, however, it calls `Derived::m2();` at run time, because there is no `virtual` keyword before `m2();` method.

**5. Key Takeaways and the `virtual` Keyword**

- The `virtual` keyword is the key to enabling dynamic binding.
- When a method is declared `virtual` in a base class, it tells the compiler, "Don't decide which function to call yet. Wait until runtime and look at the actual object type."
- If a base class declares a method `virtual`, derived classes _should_ also use `virtual` when overriding that method (though it's technically optional in derived classes _after_ the initial `virtual` declaration, it's good practice and essential for clarity. The speaker emphasize that if a base class has `virtual` all derived and sub-derived should have it to, except the last level).
- Dynamic binding only applies when you're working with _pointers or references_ to base class objects. If you have a `Base` object directly (not a pointer), static binding is always used.
- Late binding is determined at runtime.

The video effectively uses a step-by-step approach with clear examples to explain a somewhat complex concept, making it accessible to learners. The core idea is to understand how the `virtual` keyword changes the way C++ resolves function calls in an inheritance hierarchy.
