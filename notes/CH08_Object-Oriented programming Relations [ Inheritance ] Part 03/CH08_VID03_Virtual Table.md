**1. Introduction to Virtual Tables (v-tables)**

- The video introduces the concept of "v-tables" (virtual tables). A v-table is a mechanism used in object-oriented programming (specifically in languages like C++) to support dynamic dispatch (also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding).
- It explains that v-tables are created at _compile time_ and are used for _overriding functions_.
- V-tables are used to store both:
  - **Static Binding Information:** For functions where the compiler knows _exactly_ which version to call at compile time, the v-table will store the direct address of that function.
  - **Dynamic Binding Information:** For `virtual` functions, where the specific version to call might not be known until runtime, the v-table stores information that allows the program to determine the correct function version _at runtime_. This is based on the _actual_ object type.

---

**2. Dynamic Binding and Pointers**

- The core idea of dynamic binding is that when you have a _pointer_ to a base class, that pointer can actually point to an object of a _derived_ class.
- When you call a `virtual` function through that pointer, the program doesn't just look at the pointer's declared type (the base class). Instead, it looks at the _actual object_ the pointer is pointing to and calls the function version defined in that object's class (the derived class).
- The v-table is consulted at _runtime_ to find the correct function to execute.

- **Example (Conceptual):** If you have a `GeoShape* p;` (a pointer to a `GeoShape` object), and `p` actually points to a `Circle` object, then `p->calculateArea();` will call the `Circle`'s version of `calculateArea()`, _not_ the `GeoShape`'s version (assuming `calculateArea()` is virtual).

---

**3. Virtual Functions and Public Inheritance**

- The video emphasizes that virtual functions and dynamic binding _only work with public inheritance_. If you use private or protected inheritance, you won't get the dynamic dispatch behavior.

---

**4. Example: GeoShape Hierarchy**

- The video revisits a previous example (presumably from an earlier lesson) involving a hierarchy of geometric shapes:
  - `GeoShape` (base class)
  - `Circle`, `Rect`, `Triangle`, `Square` (derived classes)
- The instructor modifies the example by:
  - Making the inheritance `public`.
  - Making the `calculateArea()` function in the `GeoShape` class `virtual`.

```cpp
class GeoShape
{
    virtual float calculateArea()
    {
        return 0;
    }
};
```

- **Explanation of `virtual`:** By adding the `virtual` keyword, the instructor indicates that derived classes are _expected_ to override this function. Furthermore, when `calculateArea()` is called through a `GeoShape` pointer, the _most derived_ version of the function (based on the actual object) will be executed.

---

**5. Example: Main Function and Dynamic Dispatch**

- The instructor demonstrates how dynamic binding works in the `main` function.
- A `GeoShape` pointer (`p`) is created.
- Several objects of derived classes (`Circle`, `Rect`, `Triangle`, `Square`) are created.

```cpp
GeoShape *p;
Circle c(10);
Rect r(30,40);
Triangle t(100, 150);
Square s(60);
```

- The pointer `p` is assigned the address of each derived class object, one at a time. Crucially, each time `p->calculateArea();` is called, the correct derived class's version is executed.

```cpp
p = &c;
p->calculateArea; // Calls Circle's calculateArea()

p = &r;
p->calculateArea; // Calls Rect's calculateArea()

p = &t;
p->calculateArea; // Calls Triangle's calculateArea()

p = &s;
p->calculateArea; // Calls Square's calculateArea()
```

_Compiler will check in the GeoShape class that method is virtual, and then at the run time, the program will invoke the function related to the object type._

---

**6. Example: `sumAreas` Function**

- A `standalone` function (not a member of any class) called `sumAreas` is created.
- This function takes _three_ `GeoShape` pointers as arguments.
- It calculates the sum of the areas of the three shapes pointed to by the pointers.
- This showcases the power of dynamic binding: You can pass _any_ combination of `GeoShape` derived objects to this function, and it will work correctly, because the `calculateArea()` calls are resolved dynamically.

```cpp
float sumAreas (GeoShape *p1, GeoShape *p2, GeoShape *p3)
{
    return p1->calculateArea() + p2->calculateArea() + p3->calculateArea();
};
```

- **Example Usage:**

```cpp
int main()
{
    Triangle myT(20,10);
    Rect myR(2,5);
    Circle myc(5);
    cout<<sumAreas (&myT, &myR, &myS)<<endl; //myS not declered in this scope, it should be myc.
};
```

---

**7. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes**

- The video introduces "pure virtual functions" (also called "abstract functions" in some languages).
- **Definition:** A pure virtual function is a `virtual` function declared in a base class but has _no implementation_ in the base class.
- **Syntax:** It's declared using `= 0;` at the end of the function declaration.

```cpp
class GeoShape
{
    virtual float calculateAre() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
```

- **Consequences of Pure Virtual Functions:**

  - **Abstract Class:** A class with _at least one_ pure virtual function becomes an _abstract class_.
  - **Cannot Create Objects:** You _cannot_ create objects directly from an abstract class. You can only create objects of _concrete_ (non-abstract) derived classes.
  - **Mandatory Overriding:** Any _concrete_ derived class _must_ provide an implementation for _all_ pure virtual functions inherited from the base class. If a derived class doesn't implement all pure virtual functions, it also becomes abstract.
  - **Purpose:** Abstract classes serve as _interfaces_ or _blueprints_. They define a common set of behaviors (the pure virtual functions) that derived classes _must_ implement.

- **Example:** If `GeoShape` has a pure virtual `calculateArea()`, then `Circle`, `Rect`, etc., _must_ provide their own `calculateArea()` implementations. If `Circle` _didn't_ implement `calculateArea()`, then `Circle` would also become an abstract class.
- **Conceptual Analogy:** The video uses an "Employee" example. You might have an abstract `Employee` class, but you wouldn't have generic "Employee" objects in your company. You'd have `Admin`, `ITEmployee`, `Engineer` objects (derived classes), each with their own specific implementations of `Employee` functions.

This comprehensive breakdown covers all the key concepts, terminology, and examples presented in the provided video transcript. It clarifies the relationship between virtual functions, pure virtual functions, abstract classes, and dynamic dispatch in C++.
