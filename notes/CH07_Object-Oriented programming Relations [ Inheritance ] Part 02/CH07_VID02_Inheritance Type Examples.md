\*1. Introduction and Problem Setup:\*\*

The video begins by introducing the concept of inheritance in C++ and sets up a practical example to illustrate its different types. The problem involves calculating the areas of various geometric shapes (triangle, rectangle, circle, and square). The instructor emphasizes the commonality: all these shapes, for area calculation, fundamentally rely on two dimensions (even if those dimensions are equal, as in the case of a circle and a square).

---

**2. The `GeoShape` Base Class:**

The instructor proposes creating a base class called `GeoShape`. This class serves as the foundation for all the geometric shapes. It contains:

- **Protected Members:** `dim1` and `dim2` (both floats), representing the two dimensions. Protected access means these members are accessible to derived classes but not directly from outside the class hierarchy.
- **Public Members:**
  - Constructors: A default constructor (setting dimensions to 0), a constructor taking one parameter (setting both dimensions to that value), and a constructor taking two parameters.
  - Setters and Getters: `setDim1()`, `setDim2()`, `getDim1()`, and `getDim2()` to manage the dimensions.
  - `calculateArea()`: A function that returns 0. This is a placeholder; the actual area calculation will be done in the derived classes. The instructor mentions it's designed this way because you won't directly create objects of `GeoShape`; you'll create objects of its derived classes.

```cpp
class GeoShape
{
protected:
    float dim1;
    float dim2;
public:
    GeoShape() {dim1 = dim2 = 0;}
    GeoShape (float x)
    { dim1 = dim2 = x; }
    GeoShape (float x, float y)
    {
        dim1 = x;
        dim2 = y;
    }
    void setDim1(float x)
    {dim1 = x; }
    void setDim2(float x)
    {dim2 = x; }
    float getDim1()
    {return dim1; }
    float getDim2()
    {return dim2; }
    float calculateArea()
    {
        return 0;
    }
};
```

**3. The `Triangle` and `Rect` (Rectangle) Derived Classes (Public Inheritance):**

The `Triangle` and `Rect` classes are derived _publicly_ from `GeoShape`. This means they inherit all public and protected members of `GeoShape` and maintain their access levels.

- **`Triangle` Class:**
  - Constructor: Takes two floats (`b` for base, `h` for height) and passes them to the `GeoShape` constructor.
  - `calculateArea()`: _Overrides_ the base class function. It implements the triangle area formula: `0.5 * dim1 * dim2`. This is an example of _function overriding_ – the derived class provides its own implementation of a function inherited from the base class.
  - Access dim1 and dim2 which are protected in the parent class.

```cpp
class Triangle: public GeoShape
{
public:
    Triangle (float b, float h) : GeoShape(b, h)
    { }
    float calculateArea()
    {
        return 0.5 * dim1 * dim2;
    }
};
```

- **`Rect` Class:**
  - Constructor: Takes two floats (`x`, `y`) and passes them to the `GeoShape` constructor.
  - `calculateArea()`: Overrides the base class function. It implements the rectangle area formula: `dim1 * dim2`.

```cpp
class Rect: public GeoShape
{
public:
    Rect (float x, float y) : GeoShape(x, y)
    { }
    float calculateArea()
    {
        return dim1 * dim2;
    }
};
```

---

**4. The `Circle` Derived Class (Private Inheritance):**

The `Circle` class demonstrates _private_ inheritance from `GeoShape`. This is a key point of the video. Private inheritance means that all public and protected members of `GeoShape` become _private_ members of `Circle`. This is done to "hide" the two dimensions from external users, as conceptually a circle is defined by a single radius.

- **Constructor:** Takes one float (`r` for radius) and passes it to the `GeoShape` constructor. Internally, it sets both `dim1` and `dim2` to `r`.
- **`setRadius()` and `getRadius()`:** These are _alias_ methods. They provide a circle-specific interface, even though the underlying implementation uses `dim1` and `dim2`. They essentially act as wrappers. The instructor notes that you _could_ override `setDim1()` instead, but `setRadius()` is more intuitive.
- `calculateArea()`: Overrides the base class function. It implements the circle area formula: `(22.0/7) * dim1 * dim2` (since `dim1` and `dim2` both hold the radius, this is equivalent to πr²).
- It is important to mention that a user creating an object of circle class will not be able to access setDim1() and setDim2() methods as they are now private, only setRadius() can be called.

```cpp
class Circle: private GeoShape
{
public:
    Circle(float r) : GeoShape(r)
    { }
    void setRadius(float r) //OR we could override: setDim1()
    {dim1 = dim2 = r; }
    float getRadius () //OR we could override: setDim1()
    {return dim1; }
    float calculateArea()
    {
        return 22.0/7 * dim1 * dim2;
    }
};

//Object from Circle can access only the public members of Circle.
// Circle c1;
// c1.setDim 1(5);  X
// c1.getDim2();    X
// c1. setRadius(5);
```

**5. The `Square` Derived Class (Private Inheritance, Multiple Levels):**

The `Square` class is derived _privately_ from `Rect`, which in turn is derived publicly from `GeoShape`. This demonstrates multiple levels of inheritance and how access levels interact. The `Square` class inherits privately to hide the two separate dimensions, as a square conceptually has only one side length.

- **Constructor:** Takes one float (`r` - used as a generic dimension) and calls GeoShape constructor.
- **`setSquareDim()` and `getSquareDim()`:** Similar to the `Circle` class, these are alias methods to provide a square-specific interface.
- **`calculateArea()`:** This is where it gets interesting. The `Square` class _overrides_ the `calculateArea()` function. However, it _calls_ the `Rect` class's `calculateArea()` function using the scope resolution operator (`Rect::calculateArea()`). This is crucial. The instructor explains:
  - `Square` inherits `calculateArea()` from `Rect` (which inherited it from `GeoShape`). Because the inheritance is _private_, `calculateArea()` from rect becomes a _private_ member of `Square`.
  - To make `calculateArea()` accessible to users of the `Square` class (i.e., from `main`), it _must_ be overridden in the `public` section of `Square`.
  - The overridden version calls `Rect::calculateArea()` to utilize the correct area calculation (which is length \* width, and since it's a square, those are the same). If it simply called `calculateArea()` without `Rect::`, it would result in infinite recursion.

```cpp
class Square: private Rect
{
public:
    Square(float r) : GeoShape(r)
    { }
    void setSquareDim(float x) //OR we could override: setDim1()
    {dim1 = dim2 = x; }
    float getSquareDim() //OR we could override: getDim1()
    {return dim1; }
    float calculateArea() //Overriding calculateArea() of Rect class.
    {
        return Rect::calculateArea();
    }
};
// Object from Square can access only the public members of Square.
// Square s1;
// s1.setDim 1(5); X
// s1.getDim2();   X
// s1. setSquareDim(5);
```

**6. Key Concepts Demonstrated:**

- **Inheritance (Public and Private):** The video shows how public inheritance makes inherited members accessible at the same level, while private inheritance makes them private in the derived class.
- **Function Overriding:** Derived classes providing their own implementations of functions inherited from base classes.
- **Protected Access:** Members accessible within the class hierarchy (to derived classes) but not from outside.
- **Alias Methods:** Creating methods with names that are conceptually appropriate for the derived class, even if they internally use members inherited from the base class.
- **Scope Resolution Operator (`::`):** Used to explicitly call a function from a specific class (e.g., `Rect::calculateArea()`).
- **Multiple levels of inheritance.**

The instructor carefully explains _why_ certain design choices are made (e.g., using private inheritance to hide implementation details) and points out potential pitfalls (like infinite recursion if `Rect::` is omitted).
