This transcript introduces a course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. It explains that OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes, which helps in organizing code efficiently. The course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of OOP and how to implement them using C++.

### **Key Points Covered in the Course:**

1. **Introduction to OOP & C++:**

   - OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
   - C++ is a powerful programming language that supports OOP, making it flexible and easy to use.

2. **Core OOP Concepts:**

   - Understanding **classes** and **objects**, which are fundamental to OOP.
   - Learning about **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism** and **encapsulation**.

3. **Advanced OOP Features in C++:**

   - Using **constructors** to initialize objects.
   - Implementing **destructors** for memory management.
   - Understanding **templates** for generic code.
   - Exploring **operator overloading** to enhance functionality.

4. **Hands-on Practice:**

   - The course includes practical exercises to reinforce learning.
   - Students will apply OOP principles to real-world examples.

5. **Course Outcome:**
   - By the end of the course, students will have a **strong understanding of OOP concepts**.
   - They will be able to write **efficient, modular, and scalable** code.
   - This knowledge will help them transition to modern OOP languages like **Java and .NET**.

Overall, the course is designed to provide both theoretical and practical knowledge, ensuring that learners can confidently implement OOP principles in C++.
