## **Understanding Operator Overloading for Assignment in C++ (Stack Class)**

### **1. The Basics of Assignment in Memory**

- The video starts by explaining the concept of assignment in basic data types.
- When assigning `x = y`, the value of `y` is copied into `x`. This means:
  - Each variable has its independent memory space.
  - Changing `x` later will not affect `y` since a separate copy was made.

### **2. Problem with Default Assignment in Objects**

- In a `Stack` object, if `s1` is assigned to `s2` (`s2 = s1`), the default assignment operator performs **bitwise copying**.
- This means:
  - The `size` and `tos` (top of stack) of `s1` are copied to `s2`.
  - The `st` pointer (which stores the stack elements) in `s2` now points to the same memory as `s1`.

#### **Issues Caused by Bitwise Copying**

1. **Memory Leak**: `s2` originally had its own allocated memory. After assignment, it loses reference to that memory, causing a memory leak.
2. **Shared Memory Issue**: `s1` and `s2` now share the same stack data. Any modification in one object will affect the other.
3. **Destructor Problem**: When one object is destroyed, the shared memory is freed, leaving the other object pointing to invalid memory.

### **3. Solution: Overloading the Assignment Operator**

To fix this issue, an **overloaded assignment operator** is implemented inside the `Stack` class.

#### **Implementation of `operator=`**

```cpp
void Stack::operator=(Stack s) {
    delete[] this->st;  // Free the existing memory
    this->tos = s.tos;
    this->size = s.size;
    this->st = new int[size];  // Allocate new memory
    for(int i = 0; i < tos; i++)
        this->st[i] = s.st[i];  // Copy values
}
```

- **First Step:** Free `s2`'s existing memory (to prevent memory leak).
- **Second Step:** Copy the `size` and `tos` values from `s1` to `s2`.
- **Third Step:** Allocate a new memory block for `s2`.
- **Fourth Step:** Copy the stack elements one by one, ensuring no shared memory.

### **4. Optimization: Using Reference (`&`) and `const`**

To further optimize, we:

- Pass the parameter **by reference** (`const Stack &s`) to avoid unnecessary object copying.
- Return the object itself by reference (`Stack&`) to support **chained assignment**.

#### **Improved Implementation**

```cpp
class Stack {
    Stack& operator=(const Stack &s);  // Overloaded assignment
};
```

This allows expressions like:

```cpp
s3 = s2 = s1;  // Now works correctly!
```

### **5. Summary of Key Learnings**

- **Default assignment operator** performs a bitwise copy, leading to **memory leaks and shared memory issues**.
- **Overloading the assignment operator** ensures **safe copying** of dynamic memory.
- **Using references (`&`) and `const`** improves efficiency and supports **chained assignments**.
