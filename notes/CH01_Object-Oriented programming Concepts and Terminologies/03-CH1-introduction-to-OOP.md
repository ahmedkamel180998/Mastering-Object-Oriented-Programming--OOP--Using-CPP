### **Detailed Summary of the Transcript in English**

#### **1. Understanding Structured Programming**

In structured programming, the approach to problem-solving involves breaking down a problem into a set of **functions** that perform specific behaviors. There is always a **main function** that calls other functions and connects them.

Looking at a **diagram** representing structured programming, we see that functions call other functions, causing the code execution to pause until the called function completes its execution and returns. This process continues until the main function completes its task.

#### **2. Problems with Structured Programming**

While structured programming provides a systematic way of coding, it has some significant issues:

- **Transformation Issue**:  
  In real-life problems, we deal not only with functions but also with **attributes (data)**. However, structured programming forces us to express everything as functions, which is not always practical.

- **Reusability Issue**:  
  When reusing code, functions that are related must be given together. For example, if we reuse `function 1`, we must also consider all connected functions like `function 4`, `function 6`, and `function 7`. This makes **reusability more difficult** because we need to track dependencies.

- **Maintenance Issue**:  
  Debugging and maintaining structured code is challenging because:
  - Identifying the **exact location of an issue** requires extensive tracing.
  - Proper **documentation** is necessary to track dependencies between functions.
  - **Handover** of code to another developer is complex because understanding the dependencies takes time.

To address these issues, we need a different approachâ€”**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

#### **3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as a Solution**

OOP offers solutions to structured programming problems by organizing code into **objects** rather than just functions.

- **Transformation Solution**:  
  Instead of only using functions, we **observe real-world entities** and represent them as **objects**.  
  Each **object** consists of:

  - **Attributes (data)**: Properties that describe the object (e.g., color, height, weight).
  - **Functionality (behaviors)**: Actions the object can perform in the system.

- **Communication Between Objects**:  
  Objects interact with each other via their functionalities.  
  For example, in a system where we have:

  - A **Student object** with attributes like `name`, `email`, and `birthdate`.
  - A **Table object** with attributes like `material` and `size`.

  Each object retains its **own properties and behaviors**, and they communicate through **functionality**, making interactions clearer and more manageable.

#### **4. Understanding Classes and Objects**

To implement OOP, we need to understand two key concepts:

- **Class**:  
  A blueprint that defines:

  - The **attributes** that objects of this type should have.
  - The **methods** (functionalities) that objects should perform.

- **Object (Instance)**:  
  A real-world representation of a class.  
  For example, if we have a **Person class**:

  - It defines attributes like `first name`, `last name`, and `email`.
  - It defines behaviors like sending an email.

  When we create specific persons (e.g., Ahmed, Ali, or Mohamed), each **object** (Ahmed, Ali, Mohamed) holds **real values** for those attributes.

- **How Objects Work in a System**:  
  Objects interact with each other in a **cooperative** way.
  - They might belong to the **same class** or **different classes**.
  - This object-based approach ensures **no data is missing** because objects encapsulate both **attributes** and **behaviors**.

---

#### **5. Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming**

The OOP approach offers multiple benefits:

- **Bottom-Up Design**:

  - The system is divided into **independent objects**.
  - Each object is defined by a **class**.
  - Objects of the same class share **common attributes and behaviors**.
  - This makes the system more **organized** and **manageable**.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**:

  - If we have an **Employee class** and a **Student class**, we can create many instances from each class without rewriting code.
  - The structure is **more focused**, making it easier to understand what functionalities each object should have.

- **Reusability Across Systems**:
  - Classes can be **reused** in multiple systems.
  - Common functionalities remain **consistent**, reducing development time.

#### **6. How OOP Solves the Reusability Issue**

OOP introduces **four key principles** to enhance reusability:

1. **Encapsulation**:

   - Objects keep their **data and methods private**.
   - Only necessary details are exposed, improving security and modularity.

2. **Polymorphism**:

   - The ability for different objects to use **the same method** in different ways.
   - This increases flexibility when designing a system.

3. **Abstraction**:

   - Hides complex details and **only exposes essential functionality**.
   - Makes code cleaner and easier to maintain.

4. **Inheritance**:
   - Allows a **child class** to inherit attributes and methods from a **parent class**.
   - Promotes **code reusability** and reduces redundancy.

Each of these principles will be explored in detail in future chapters.

### **Conclusion**

OOP is a **more efficient approach** than structured programming because:

- It organizes code into **objects** instead of just functions.
- Objects encapsulate both **data (attributes)** and **functionality (behaviors)**.
- It improves **reusability, scalability, and maintainability**.
- The four **core OOP principles** (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance) provide **structured solutions** to common coding challenges.

This structured approach allows developers to build **more flexible and reusable** systems that can be easily extended or modified over time.
