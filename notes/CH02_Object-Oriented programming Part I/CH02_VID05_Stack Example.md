# Understanding Stack Data Structure in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## **Introduction to Stack**

- The **stack** is a fundamental **data structure** that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.
- It represents a **container** where elements are placed on top of each other.
- The last element added to the stack is always the **first one to be removed**.

## **Core Operations of a Stack**

1. **Push Operation**

   - Inserts an element at the **top** of the stack.
   - Always occurs from **one direction**.
   - Example: If we push elements in this order: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**, the stack will store them in this sequence.

2. **Pop Operation**
   - Removes the element from the **top** of the stack.
   - The last element that was pushed is the **first to be popped**.
   - Example: If we pop elements from the stack containing **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**, they will be removed in this order: **5, 4, 3, 2, 1**.

## **Tracing Stack Operations with an Example**

- Suppose we represent the stack using an **array** with a pointer (index) that tracks the **top** position.
- **Initial State:** The stack is empty, and the `top` index is at `0`.
- **Push Operations:**
  - `push(2) →` Insert `2` at the top position and move `top` up.
  - `push(5) →` Insert `5` and move `top` up.
  - `push(7) →` Insert `7` and move `top` up.
  - `push(1) →` Insert `1` and move `top` up.
- **When is the Stack Full?**
  - If the `top` index equals the **size** of the stack, no more elements can be pushed.
  - Attempting `push(3)` on a full stack results in an **error**.
- **Pop Operations:**
  - `pop() →` Move `top` down and remove the last inserted element.
  - Repeating `pop()` will eventually empty the stack.

## **Designing a Stack Class in OOP**

To represent a stack in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, we define a class with the following components:

### **Attributes of the Stack Class**

1. **Size** (`size`): An integer representing the total capacity of the stack.
2. **Pointer to an Array** (`arr`): The dynamic array storing stack elements.
3. **Top Index** (`top`): Tracks the current top position in the stack.

### **Constructing the Stack Class**

- The **constructor** initializes the stack with a default or user-defined size.
- **Memory Allocation**:
  - The array is dynamically allocated with the given size.
  - The `top` index is set to `0` (indicating an empty stack).
- **Destructor**:
  - Ensures that dynamically allocated memory is freed when the stack object is destroyed.

### **Implementing Stack Operations**

1. **Push Function**

   - Inserts an element into the stack at the `top` index.
   - **Before pushing**, it checks if the stack has space.
   - Moves the `top` index **up** after inserting the element.

2. **Pop Function**
   - Removes and retrieves the element at the `top` index.
   - **Before popping**, it checks if the stack is empty (`top == 0`).
   - Moves the `top` index **down** after removal.
   - Returns `-1` if the stack is empty (as an indicator for developers).

## **Testing the Stack Class**

- A simple **`main()` function** can be used to test the stack implementation.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  Stack s1(2); // Creates a stack with size 2
  s1.push(10);
  s1.push(20);
  cout << s1.pop(); // Outputs 20
  ```
- Developers can create multiple stack objects, test push/pop operations, and explore how the stack data structure functions.
