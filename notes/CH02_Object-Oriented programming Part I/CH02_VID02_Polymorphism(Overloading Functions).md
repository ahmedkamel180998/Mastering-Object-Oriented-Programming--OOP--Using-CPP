### **Detailed Summary of the Transcript: Polymorphism and Function Overloading**

This transcript provides an explanation of the **Polymorphism** concept in programming, focusing on **Function Overloading**. The explanation is structured with definitions, examples, and edge cases. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key ideas discussed:

---

## **1. Introduction to Polymorphism**

Polymorphism means **"multiple forms"** and allows the same function name to perform different tasks depending on the context. One of the main types of polymorphism in programming is **Function Overloading**.

---

## **2. Understanding Function Overloading**

Function Overloading occurs when multiple functions share the **same name** but differ in their **signatures** (parameters).

### **Definition of a Function Signature**

A function signature consists of four elements:

- **Function Name**
- **Number of Parameters**
- **Types of Parameters**
- **Order of Parameters**

For **Function Overloading** to be valid:

- The functions **must** have the same name.
- They **must** be inside the same class.
- They **must** differ in **at least one aspect** of their signature (number, type, or order of parameters).

## **3. Example of Function Overloading in a Complex Number Class**

The explanation includes an example using a class named **Complex**, which was introduced in a previous chapter.

### **Adding Functionality to Class Complex**

A new method called **SetComplex** is created to set the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. There are two versions of this method:

1. **SetComplex (Two Parameters)**

   - Takes two values (one for the real part and one for the imaginary part).

2. **SetComplex (One Parameter)**
   - Takes one value and assigns it to **both** the real and imaginary parts.

Since the two functions have the **same name but different signatures**, they **successfully demonstrate Function Overloading**.

---

## **4. Edge Case: Default Parameter Leading to Ambiguity Error**

A potential mistake is highlighted where a **default parameter** causes a compilation error due to ambiguity.

### **What happens if a default value is added?**

- Suppose the **first function** (SetComplex with two parameters) has a default value for the second parameter.
- This means that calling `SetComplex(5)` could refer to **either** of the overloaded functions.
- Since the compiler cannot determine which function to execute, it generates an **Ambiguity Error**.

### **Key Rule**

➡️ **Default parameters do not count when determining unique function signatures.**  
➡️ If two functions become identical **after accounting for default parameters**, overloading **is not allowed**.

## **5. Summary of Key Takeaways**

✔ **Function Overloading** allows multiple functions with the same name to exist in a class if they differ in parameters.  
✔ Functions must be **uniquely distinguishable** by their signatures.  
✔ **Default parameters** can lead to **ambiguity errors**, making overloading invalid in some cases.  
✔ The compiler **rejects ambiguous function calls** where it cannot determine which function to execute.
