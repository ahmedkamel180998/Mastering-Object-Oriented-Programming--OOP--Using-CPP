# **Understanding Static Members in C++**

**Time Interval:** Full Discussion

## **Introduction to Static Members**

- **Definition:** Static members (attributes or functions) in a class are shared among all objects instantiated from that class.
- **Example:** If we have a `Student` class with an attribute `batch_number`, all student objects will share the same value rather than having separate copies.

## **Static Attributes (Static Data Members)**

- **Regular Attributes vs. Static Attributes:**
  - A regular attribute creates a separate copy for each object.
  - A static attribute has only **one shared copy**, accessible by all objects.
- **Memory Allocation:**
  - Static attributes are stored separately in memory, not inside individual objects.
  - They persist **throughout the application’s lifetime**.
- **Comparison with Global Variables:**
  - Unlike general global variables, a static attribute belongs to a specific class and is **restricted in scope**.
- **Accessing Static Attributes:**
  - Can be accessed via the **class name** (recommended) or through an **object**.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    class Student {
        static int batch_number;
    };
    ```
- **Initialization:**
  - A static attribute must be explicitly initialized outside the class.
  - It has a single value shared across all instances.
- **Accessibility:**
  - It can be `private` or `public`, controlling access from outside the class.

## **Example: Using Static Attributes in a Stack Data Structure**

- **Scenario:**
  - We introduce a static attribute `stack_number` in a `Stack` class.
  - All objects of `Stack` share the same `stack_number`.
- **Using Static Members for Object Counting:**
  - To track the number of `Stack` objects created, we define a **static counter** inside the class.
  - Implementation:
    ```cpp
    class Stack {
        private:
            static int counter;
        public:
            Stack() { counter++; }  // Increment on object creation
            ~Stack() { counter--; } // Decrement on object destruction
    };
    ```
  - **Behavior:**
    - The counter increases when an object is instantiated.
    - It decreases when an object is destroyed.

## **Static Functions (Class Functions)**

- **Definition:**
  - A static function is a function defined as `static` inside a class.
  - It is also called a **class function**.
- **Restrictions of Static Functions:**
  - Static functions **only interact** with static attributes and other static functions.
  - They **cannot access non-static attributes** unless through an object.
- **Reason for Restrictions:**
  - Unlike normal member functions, **static functions do not have a `this` pointer**, because they are not tied to a specific object.
- **Calling Static Functions:**
  - Can be called using the **class name** or an object (class name is preferred).
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    class Stack {
        private:
            static int counter;
        public:
            static int getCounter() { return counter; }
    };
    ```
- **Why Use Static Functions?**
  - If a static attribute is `private`, direct access is not allowed.
  - Instead, a **static getter function** (e.g., `getCounter()`) provides controlled access to its value.
  - The function is called like this:
    ```cpp
    int totalStacks = Stack::getCounter();
    ```

## **Conclusion**

- **Static attributes** allow memory-efficient, shared values across objects.
- **Static functions** enable interaction with static attributes in a controlled manner.
- Using static members correctly improves encapsulation and efficiency, especially when tracking shared values like object counts.
