### **Summary of the Transcript: Understanding `viewContent` as a Friend Function in Stack Implementation**

---

### **Introduction to the Problem**

The discussion focuses on implementing a standalone function named `viewContent` that prints all elements in a stack without modifying it. The function should loop through the stack from the top and display its contents while ensuring that the stack remains unchanged.

However, a problem arises: since `viewContent` is a standalone function, it cannot directly access the `private` members of the `Stack` class, such as `topOfStack` and `st` (the array holding stack elements). This would cause compilation errors.

### **Solution: Using a Friend Function**

To resolve this, `viewContent` should be declared as a `friend` function inside the `Stack` class. Declaring a function as a `friend` allows it to access private members of the class. This ensures `viewContent` can access and print the elements of the stack without violating encapsulation.

### **Tracing the Execution of `viewContent`**

#### **Step 1: Creating the Stack Object**

- In `main()`, a `Stack` object `s` is instantiated.
- The constructor is called, initializing:
  - `size` (capacity of the stack).
  - `topOfStack` (index of the topmost element).
  - `st` (a dynamically allocated array to store elements).

#### **Step 2: Pushing Elements into the Stack**

- Several values are pushed into `s` until it is full.
- The `topOfStack` now holds the index of the last inserted element.

#### **Step 3: Calling `viewContent`**

- `viewContent(s)` is invoked, passing `s` by **value**.
- Inside `viewContent`, the stack is copied into `x`, creating a new object.

#### **Step 4: Bitwise Copying Issue**

- Since `x` is created via **pass-by-value**, it undergoes **bitwise copying**:
  - `topOfStack` is copied from `s` to `x`.
  - `size` is copied as well.
  - **However, `st` (the dynamically allocated array’s address) is also copied**, meaning both `s` and `x` share the same array in memory.

#### **Step 5: The Hidden Danger—Destructor Issue**

- At the end of `viewContent`, the `x` object goes out of scope and is destroyed.
- The destructor of `Stack` is invoked, which calls `delete[] st`.
- Since `s` and `x` share the same array, deleting `st` in `x` **also removes the array in `s`**.
- Now, `s` has a dangling pointer (`st` points to a freed memory location).
- If `s` is accessed later, it could cause undefined behavior or a crash.

### **Possible Solutions to Avoid the Issue**

1. **Pass by Reference Instead of Value:**  
   Instead of passing `s` by value, pass it by reference (`const Stack& s`). This prevents copying and ensures `viewContent` only reads data without modifying it.

2. **Implement a Proper Copy Constructor:**

   - Instead of using default bitwise copying, define a custom copy constructor.
   - The copy constructor should allocate new memory for `st` and copy its contents instead of just copying the address.

3. **Use Smart Pointers (if applicable):**

   - If using modern C++, **smart pointers** like `std::unique_ptr` can manage dynamic memory safely.
   - This ensures that memory is correctly managed without causing shared deletion issues.

4. **Avoid Removing the Destructor:**
   - Removing the destructor is not a viable solution.
   - Without a destructor, dynamically allocated arrays would remain in memory, causing a memory leak.

### **Conclusion**

The problem arises due to passing the stack object by **value**, leading to unintended shared memory between the original and copied objects. A better approach is to pass by **reference** or implement a **deep copy constructor** to ensure each object manages its own memory safely.
