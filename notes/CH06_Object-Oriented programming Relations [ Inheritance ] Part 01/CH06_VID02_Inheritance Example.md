**1. Introduction to Inheritance and Example Setup**

The instructor begins by explaining the concept of inheritance in C++ using a simple example. They propose creating a `Base` class and a `Derived` class that inherits from it.

- **Base Class:** Contains two private integer members, `a` and `b`.
- **Derived Class:** Inherits from `Base` and adds a private integer member, `c`.

The goal is to demonstrate how the `Derived` class can access and utilize members of the `Base` class, emphasizing the principles of public inheritance.

**2. Writing the Base Class**

The instructor walks through writing the code for the `Base` class. Key points include:

- **Private Members:** `a` and `b` are declared as `private`, meaning they can only be accessed directly within the `Base` class itself.
- **Public Members:**
  - **Constructors:** Three constructors are provided: a default constructor (setting `a` and `b` to 0), a constructor taking one integer (setting both `a` and `b` to that value), and a constructor taking two integers (setting `a` and `b` to the respective values).
  - **Setters and Getters:** `setA()`, `setB()`, `getA()`, and `getB()` functions are provided to allow controlled access to the private members.
  - **`productAB()`:** A function that returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- No Knowledge of child: The video emphasis that, base class, parent, or super class do not have any information about the child class.

```cpp
class Base
{
private:
    int a;
    int b;
public:
    Base()
    {a=b=0;}
    Base(int n)
    {a=b=n;}
    Base(int x,int y)
    {a=x; b=y;}
    void setA(int x)
    {a=x;}
    void setB(int y)
    {b=y;}
    int getA()
    {return a ;}
    int getB()
    {return b;}
    int productAB()
    {return a*b;}
};
```

**3. Writing the Derived Class**

The instructor then explains how to write the `Derived` class, focusing on:

- **Public Inheritance:** The `Derived` class inherits _publicly_ from the `Base` class using the syntax `class Derived : public Base`. This means that the public members of `Base` become public members of `Derived`, and the protected members of `Base` become protected members of `Derived`. Private members of `Base` are _inaccessible_ directly from `Derived`.
- **Private Member:** `c` is declared as `private` in the `Derived` class.
- **Constructors:** Three constructors are provided, mirroring the `Base` class constructors, and crucially, they _explicitly call the Base class constructors_.
  - `Derived()`: Calls `Base()` to initialize the inherited members.
  - `Derived(int n)`: Calls `Base(n)` to initialize the inherited members.
  - `Derived(int x, int y, int z)`: Calls `Base(x, y)` to initialize the inherited members.
    This demonstrates constructor chaining, a fundamental concept in inheritance.
- **`setC()` and `getC()`:** Setter and getter methods for the `c` member.
- **`productABC()`:** This function is intended to return the product of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The instructor initially makes a deliberate error by writing `return a * b * c;`, which will cause a compilation error because `a` and `b` are _private_ to the `Base` class and therefore inaccessible. The correct implementation, `return this->productAB() * c;` (or just `return productAB() * c;` since `this->` is often implicit), is then shown. This correctly uses the `Base` class's `productAB()` function to access `a` and `b`.

```cpp
class Derived : public Base
{
private:
    int c;
public:
    Derived() :Base()
    {c=0;}
    Derived (int n) : Base(n)
    { c = n;}
    Derived (int x,int y,int z) : Base(x,y)
    {c= z;}
    void setC(int z)
    {c= z;}
    int getC()
    {return c ;}
    int productABC()
    {
        return a*b*c; //Initial error
        return this->productAB() * c; //Correct
    }
};
```

**4. Understanding Accessibility and Method Resolution**

A large portion of the video is dedicated to explaining how the compiler resolves method calls in the presence of inheritance. The key takeaways are:

- **Compiler Search Order:** When a method is called on an object of the `Derived` class, the compiler first checks if the `Derived` class itself has a matching (public or protected) method. If not, it checks the `Base` class (and continues up the inheritance hierarchy if there are more base classes).
- **Private Members are Inaccessible:** Even though the `Derived` class _inherits_ the private members of `Base`, it cannot directly access them. This is why the initial `a * b * c` in `productABC()` failed.
- **Using `this->`:** The `this->` pointer, although often implicit, explicitly refers to the current object. In `productABC()`, `this->productAB()` makes it clear that we are calling the `productAB()` method. Because `productAB()` is a public member of `Base`, and `Derived` inherits publicly from `Base`, `Derived` can call `productAB()`.
- **Parent and child:** Parent class can not see or know anything about the child class.

**5. Example with `main()`**

The instructor demonstrates the behavior of the classes with code in the `main()` function.

- **Creating a `Derived` Object:** An object `obj1` of type `Derived` is created. The default constructors are called, setting `a`, `b`, and `c` to 0 initially.
- **Using Setters:** `obj1.setA(3)`, `obj1.setB(7)`, and `obj1.setC(1)` are called. The instructor explains how the compiler resolves these calls. `setA` and `setB` are found in the `Base` class (and are accessible because of public inheritance). `setC` is found in the `Derived` class.
- **Calling `productAB()` and `productABC()`:** These methods are called, and the correct output is produced. The explanation reinforces how `productABC()` correctly uses `productAB()` to access the inherited members.

```cpp
int main()
{
    Derived obj1;
    obj1.setA(3);
    obj1.setB(7);
    obj1.setC(1);
    cout<<obj1.productAB()<<endl ;
    cout<<obj1.productABC()<<endl;
}
```

- **Creating a `Base` Object:** An object `b` of type `Base` is created. The instructor emphasizes that the `Base` object is _completely independent_ of the `Derived` class. It has no knowledge of `c` or any `Derived` class methods.
- **Calling `setC()` on Base:** When call `b.setC(1)` , compile-time error happened, cause base class don't have setC method.
- **Using Setters and `productAB()`:** `b.setA(3)` and `b.setB(7)` work as expected. `b.productAB()` correctly returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- **Attempting to Call `productABC()` on Base:** Calling `b.productABC()` results in a compilation error, as the `Base` class has no such method. This illustrates that a `Base` class object cannot access members or methods that are specific to the `Derived` class.

```cpp
int main()
{
    Base b(5,4);
    b.setA(3);
    b.setB(7);
    b.setC(1); // Compile-time error: 'class Base' has no member named 'setC'
    cout<<b.productAB()<<endl;
    cout<<b.productABC()<<endl ; // Compile-time error: 'class Base' has no member named 'productABC'
}
```

**6. Constructor Initialization and Destructor Order**

The video also briefly touches on constructor initialization order in inheritance, mentioning that:

- **Constructor Order:** When a `Derived` object is created, the `Base` class constructor is called _first_, then the `Derived` class constructor. The presented example in the video is related to composition and inheritance, where manager class inherits from Employee and compose two objects b1, and b2:

  ```cpp
  Manager: Manager() : Employee() b1(3), b2(4,3){
      ...
  }
  ```

  The constructor order is:

  1.  Employee
  2.  b1
  3.  b2
  4.  Manager.

- **Destructor Order:** Destructors are called in the _reverse_ order of constructors. The presented example in the video is related to composition and inheritance, where manager class inherits from Employee and compose two objects b1, and b2.

  ```cpp
  Manager: Manager() : Employee() b1(3), b2(4,3){
  ...
  }

  ```

  The destructor order is:

  1.  Manager.
  2.  b2
  3.  b1
  4.  Employee

In summary, the video provides a practical demonstration of fundamental inheritance concepts in C++, including public inheritance, constructor chaining, method resolution, accessibility rules, and the relationship between base and derived class objects. The deliberate inclusion of an initial error helps to highlight the importance of understanding private member access. The examples with `main()` clearly show how objects of each class behave and interact.
